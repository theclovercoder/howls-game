<h1>Howls Moving Castle Game üè∞</h1>
I wanted to create a short and simple  HTML game in order to understand how coding languages connect with one another
This project was inspired by Howls Moving Castle by Hayao Miyazaki and @nashgallery. 
<h1>Tech Stack üîß</h1>
Tech: Aesprite (Artwork), Figma (Prototyping), HTML, CSS, JavaScript
I initially started creating the artwork in aesprite before prototyping in figma. Aesprite has a function to automaticially resize your artwork which I did not know till I finished the project this morning. Now the coding, I took the insipiration of nashgallery's project but this required a lot of customization. As a result, the CSS had to be completely stripped. The HTML needed a couple of tweaks as well.
<h1>Learnedüí°</h1>
I learned about how divs work and the difference between certain positions (absolute/relative/etc). One of my <i>omg it works!</i>moments was when I finally figured out how to make the box fit inside the other one which is funny. I also learned that CSS can quickly become something that is confusing when it is not organized. I kept having to command f things in the file because I got lost. And if it was not so organized it could have been worse. 

super fun project!
